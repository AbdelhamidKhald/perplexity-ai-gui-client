Your Perplexity AI GUI Client project is now ready to be uploaded to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## ‚úÖ **Already Completed:**

4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `perplexity-ai-gui-client`

5. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. **Connect Your Local Repository**

# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/perplexity-ai-gui-client.git

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Notes:**

### **Your API Key is PROTECTED:**

1. Copy `pplx_api_key.example.txt` to `pplx_api_key.txt`
2. Replace the content with their actual Perplexity API key
3. Run `python run.py` to start the application

## üìù **Repository Contents:**

Your repository will include:
